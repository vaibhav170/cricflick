                                          Total Cricket Scorer, the new cricket scorebook software has been designed to allow the user to enter
                                           ball-by-ball information for a cricket match just as you would in a traditional
                                           cricket scorebook. You can then review the data
                                           to determine player's strengths and weaknesses and view batting statistics and bowling statistics.

This information can be viewed as the data is entered (thus providing real-time feedback on the current match), or
 reviewed at a later date so that match plans or practice regimes can be targetted correctly.
